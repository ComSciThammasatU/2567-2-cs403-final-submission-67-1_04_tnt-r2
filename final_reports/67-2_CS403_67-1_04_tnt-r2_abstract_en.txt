Development of a Data Labeling Program for Training Medical AI Models

In today's world, where artificial intelligence (AI) plays a significant role in every 
society to assist and advance various fields, including medical, the accuracy of AI heavily 
depends on the precision and volume of annotated data. The project team aims to support 
and develop a program for data labeling, especially for medical.

Given the wide variety of data label programs, six programs were selected for 
comparison: CVAT, ImageTagger, VoTT, LabelMe, Label Studio, and  Roboflow. Additionally, the 
study explored challenges related to medical data collection.

It was found that these six programs share both similarities and differences in their 
functionalities, including the types of annotations (e.g., bounding boxes and segmentation) and 
file export formats suitable for further use. Some programs incorporate AI to assist in predicting.

We need to select functionalities that are most suitable for creating medical data labeling. 
These labels can then be used to develop models for AI applications in the medical field.
